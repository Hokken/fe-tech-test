Here is how I approach this project and most projects from concept to deployment:

1. 1 hour - Research the project and understand the requirements(2h)

2. 1 hour - Create a NOTES.md file that contains my approach to the project with the following sections:

      - project requirements (framework, bundler, packages, etc.)
      - design patterns and architecture decisions
      - types
      - UI/UX
      - component hierarchy
      - hooks
      - core logic
      - separate utilities methods needed
      - state management pattern
      - error handling
      - optional features

3. 30 minSubmit the NOTES.md to Claude Code for skeleton implementation and basic folder and file structure

      - Review the code skeleton and make any necessary changes to make sure it is aligned with my initial notes and intended architecture/patterns
      - adjust to my requirements if necessary

4. 3 hours - implement, flesh out and adjust the code in tandem with Cursor for fast workflow (especially regarding boiler plate and micro implementation of Tailwind styling)

5. 30 min - Test/Optimize,the project and make any necessary changes to the code skeleton

6. 30 min - implement testing (if needed)

7. 1 hour - Polish and optimize the project

8. 30 min - deployment (if needed)
